# OneSkin

## Overview

OneSkin is a mobile application developed during a 5-day hackathon, aimed at enabling users to assess skin lesions using AI-based analysis for early detection of skin conditions. Users can conveniently capture a picture of a skin lesion from any part of their body and receive an instant analysis from our proprietary model. The analysis provides insights into the nature of the lesion (benign or malignant) and suggests appropriate next steps for monitoring and follow-up with healthcare providers.

## Built With

OneSkin leverages the following technologies:

- Flutter: for developing the cross-platform mobile application ensuring compatibility with both iOS and Android devices.
- TensorFlow: initially used for building a custom skin lesion analysis model.
- Vertex AI: later transitioned to Google's Vertex AI for easier integration of the AI model with the app.
- Express.js: for creating a backend infrastructure to utilize the AI model hosted on Vertex AI.
- Google Cloud Platform: for scalable and reliable cloud hosting of backend services.

## Future Enhancements

As we move forward, we plan to enhance OneSkin by:

- **Data Enhancement**: Seeking additional resources to train the AI model with more data to improve accuracy and reliability.
- **Feature Expansion**: Implementing features to store and track skin lesions, allowing users to monitor changes over time.
- **Advanced Imaging**: Exploring capabilities to identify and map out concerning skin lesions from larger images for comprehensive analysis.

Stay tuned for updates as we continue to evolve OneSkin to better serve your skin health needs!
